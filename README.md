Technologies Used:

- Semantic HTML5 (https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
- CSS - http://www.css3.info/

Framework entirely based on CSS Felxbox. (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

Testing:

I have used the https://validator.w3.org/ to validate the use of my html and correct any errors found such as
image alt tags that were missing and incorrect use of sections and headings.

I have used the css validator on https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ and uploaded my CSS file to check for any
errors or mistakes. It came out clean on the first run.

I have tested the functionality on a variety of browsers
- Edge
- Internet explorer 11
- Firefox
- Tor browser
- Chrome
- Mobile browsers
- Safari which i could not test as Safari will not install properly on windows 10

I have asked friends and family to use the website and give me their feedback. This resulted in making
changes to layout and styling the navigation.

Chrome developer tools was used to test if all links worked and if there were no errors upon loading.

Deployment:

I have used cloud9 to work on the coding of the website. https://c9.io/jvegter77

The website is hosted on Github pages https://jvegter77.github.io/milestone-one-the-monkees/

To run the code locally go to https://github.com/jvegter77/milestone-one-the-monkees and press clone or download
to download a copy of the entire repo.
