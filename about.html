        <h1>All about The Monkees</h1>
        <article>
            <p>With such a rich history it would almost be a crime not to fill you in on some of the finest monkee moments. It started in 1965 when we were 
            casted for a US television show. Some of us had some experience with instruments and vocals but not all of us. The show aired for 2 consecutive
            years before it got cancelled.</p>
            <p>During the show we got better as a band and gained a lot of fans. That's why The Monkees went on several tours all over the world. On the timeline we have
            gathered some awesome moments in the history of our band. You can also read a short bio of all of the bandmembers.</p>

                <p>From 1966 to 1971, Jones was a member of the Monkees. Jones was shortlisted for auditions, as he was the only Monkee who was signed to a 
                deal with the studio, but still had to meet producers Bob Rafelson's and Bert Schneider's standards. Jones sang lead vocals on many of the 
                Monkees' recordings, including "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream Believer". The DVD release of the first season of the show contained 
                commentary from the various bandmates.

                <h4>Mickey</h4>
                <p>In 1965, Dolenz was cast in the television sitcom The Monkees and became the drummer and a lead vocalist in the band created for the show. 
                He was not actually a drummer and needed lessons even to be able to mime credibly, but eventually was taught how to play properly. By the 
                time The Monkees went on tour in late 1966, Dolenz was competent enough to play the drums himself. He learned to play right-handed and 
                left-footed because of a leg disease called Perthes making his right leg weak.</p>

                <p>From 1965 to early 1970, Nesmith was a member of The Monkees. According to his May 2015 interview on Gilbert Gottfried's podcast, someone
                showed him a copy of the famous press advertisement asking for "four insane boys" so he applied for the job. Nesmith won his role largely 
                by appearing blas√© when he auditioned. He rode his motorcycle to the audition, and wore a wool hat to keep his hair out of his eyes; 
                producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider remembered "Wool Hat", and called Nesmith back.</p>

                <p>Tork was a proficient musician, and though the group was not allowed to play their own instruments on their first two albums, he was an 
                exception, playing what he described as "third chair guitar" on Mike Nesmith's song, "Papa Gene's Blues," from their first album. He 
                subsequently played keyboards, bass guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on the recordings. He also co-wrote, along with 
                Joey Richards, the closing theme song of the second season of The Monkees, "For Pete's Sake".</p>
