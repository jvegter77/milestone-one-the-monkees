        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <article>
            <p>We were casted for a US television show about a band called 'The Monkees'. The show was about a band starting up and it aired for two consecutive years.
            None of us had any experience in making music but we learned quickly. After the show we started touring because we had built a large fan base and our
            fans wanted to see us live on stage. So what has happened the past years until know? Indulge yourselve in Monkee history.</p>
